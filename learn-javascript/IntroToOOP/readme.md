## OOP
OOP (object oriented programming) refers to languages that uses objects in programming. <br>
The main aim of OOP is to bind togeher the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. <br>

## Class
class is a blueprint for creating particular data structures, providing initial values for state, and implementations of behavior.

## Object
object is an instance of a class which has the structure of its blueprint but also owns its unique state and behavior. <br>

## encapsulation
encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. other objects don't have direct access to this state.

## abstraction
abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it and should hide internal implementation details.

## ingeritance
objects are often similiar. they share common logic. with inheritance, the child class reuses all reuses all fields and methods of the parent class and can implement its own.

## polymorphism
polymorphism means "may shapes". it gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent, but each child class keeps its own methods as they are.
