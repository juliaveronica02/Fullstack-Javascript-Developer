## Primitive Values
1. Numbers. <br>
2. Strings. <br>
3. Boolean. <br>

```javascript
let a = 5;
let grt_str = "Hello World";
let bool_val = 0;
```
When execute the above lines, JS will tell computer:<br>
variable named 'a' and remember its value is 5. <br>
variable named 'grt_str' and remember its value is "Hello World".<br>
variable named 'bool_val' and remember its value is 0.<br>

## Non Primitive values
1. objects. <br>
2. Array (which is actually a special kind of object). <br>

```javascript
let fox_arr = ["JS", "Python", "PHP"];

let fox_obj = {
    'name': 'FoxBits',
    'type': 'web',
    'age' : 2
};
```
